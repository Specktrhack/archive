1. Project Definition, Purpose, and Scope
1.1. Introduction and Task Definition
This document presents the results of a penetration test conducted on the oak.gs domain and its related systems. The project's objective was to identify security vulnerabilities in the company's internet-facing services by following a structured approach:
Discover the IP address and its historical changes for the given domain.
List other domains previously hosted on the same IP addresses.
Enumerate all subdomains for the collected domains.
Identify the running services (ports, versions, etc.) for each discovered domain and subdomain.
Detect and analyze security vulnerabilities across the entire discovered infrastructure.
Document all tools (including versions) and procedures in detail.
1.2. Primary Objective
To identify the company's internet-facing services and associated domains, starting from oak.gs.
To discover and report potential security vulnerabilities on these domains and services.
1.3. Scope
Primary Target: oak.gs
Associated Systems: All discovered subdomains, IP addresses, and the services running on them.
Special Focus: The subdomain sign.oak.gs was subjected to detailed vulnerability scans using OWASP ZAP and Nessus Essentials.
2. Methodology and Tools Used
2.1. Methodology Phases
Passive Reconnaissance: Gathering information from publicly available sources without direct interaction with the target systems.
Active Reconnaissance and Scanning: Interacting with the target systems in a controlled manner to gather more detailed information and search for vulnerabilities.
Vulnerability Assessment: Analyzing the impact and likelihood of potential vulnerabilities to determine their risk level.
2.2. Key Tools Used
DNS & General Reconnaissance: whois, nslookup, dig, SecurityTrails, VirusTotal
Subdomain Enumeration: subfinder, gobuster
Port Scanning & Service Detection: nmap
SSL/TLS Configuration Analysis: sslscan, nmap (with relevant scripts)
Web Application Firewall (WAF) Detection: wafw00f
Web Application Vulnerability Scanning: OWASP ZAP (on sign.oak.gs)
Network & System Vulnerability Scanning: Nessus Essentials (on sign.oak.gs)
Exploit Database Queries: searchsploit
SQL Injection Testing: sqlmap (controlled test on a specific URL)
3. Main Domain (oak.gs): General Analysis and IP History
3.1. Whois Record Analysis
Registrar: GoDaddy
Email Infrastructure Provider: Yandex
3.2. IP Address History (SecurityTrails Data)
Current Hosting: Primarily on AWS (Amazon Web Services) infrastructure (S3, CloudFront, Global Accelerator).
Historical Hosting: Records indicate previous hosting with providers such as Contabo GmbH.
3.3. DNS Record Analysis
Core DNS Records: A, MX (Yandex), NS (GoDaddy), TXT (SPF record present).
Identified Gap: No AAAA (IPv6) record was found.
DNSSEC Status: UNSIGNED.
Associated Risk (Low): This presents a theoretical vulnerability to DNS spoofing and cache poisoning attacks.
Recommendation: Consider enabling DNSSEC for the domain.
4. Subdomain Enumeration and Attack Surface Analysis
4.1. Key Discovered Subdomains (Examples)
sign.oak.gs (This domain was selected for detailed analysis)
xmpp.*, storage.*, api.*, test.*
sentry.*, sonarqube.*, graylog.* (These names often indicate development, testing, or monitoring tools)
4.2. Risk Assessment
Medium. The existence of numerous subdomains naturally increases the potential entry points and expands the attack surface that must be managed.
5. Focus Point: Detailed Analysis of sign.oak.gs
5.1. Rationale, DNS, and WAF
Rationale: This subdomain was chosen for a more in-depth review as a representative web application.
DNS Resolution: The domain has a CNAME record pointing to d38159j2yt9llc.cloudfront.net, indicating it runs behind Amazon's CloudFront CDN.
WAF Detection: Amazon CloudFront WAF was confirmed using wafw00f.
5.2. SSL/TLS Configuration Analysis
Supported Strong Protocols: TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3.
Old/Weak Protocols (SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1): DISABLED (Secure configuration).
Heartbleed Vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160): Not Detected (Secure).
Cipher Suites: Strong and modern algorithms are in use.
Overall Assessment: The SSL/TLS configuration of sign.oak.gs is generally robust and conforms to current security standards.
6. Vulnerability Scan Results (sign.oak.gs)
6.1. Nessus Scan Summary
Nessus identified 1 Medium, 0 Low, and 24 Informational findings.
Severity	CVSS v3.0	Plugin ID	Description
MEDIUM	6.5	142960	HSTS Missing From HTTPS Server (RFC 6797)
INFO	N/A	45590	Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)
INFO	N/A	54615	Device Type
INFO	N/A	10107	HTTP Server Type and Version
INFO	N/A	12053	Host Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) Resolution
INFO	N/A	50344	Missing or Permissive Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors
INFO	N/A	50345	Missing or Permissive X-Frame-Options Header
INFO	N/A	11936	OS Identification
INFO	N/A	56984	SSL/TLS Versions Supported

INFO	N/A	21643	SSL Cipher Suites Supported
INFO	N/A	136318	TLS Version 1.2 Protocol Detection
INFO	N/A	138330	TLS Version 1.3 Protocol Detection
6.2. OWASP ZAP Scan Summary
Sensitive File/Directory Access: Attempts to access common sensitive files (WEB-INF/web.xml, .env, etc.) resulted in 404 Not Found responses, a positive security indicator.
Cloud Metadata Service Access: Attempts to access cloud provider metadata services (/latest/meta-data/) resulted in 403 Forbidden responses, indicating good protection against SSRF.
Overall Assessment: No obvious, directly exploitable web application vulnerabilities were identified on sign.oak.gs.
7. Disclosures and Recommendations
7.1. Key Findings (Disclosures)
Medium Risk
Large Attack Surface: The discovery of numerous subdomains (xmpp.*, sentry.*, etc.) expands the attack surface, creating risk through potentially forgotten, unpatched, or misconfigured systems.
HSTS Header Missing: The sign.oak.gs subdomain does not send a Strict-Transport-Security header, leaving users vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks like SSL Stripping.
Low-to-Medium Risk
Missing Security Headers (Clickjacking Risk): The absence of X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors headers on sign.oak.gs creates a risk of clickjacking attacks.
Insufficient Email Security: While a basic SPF record is present, the lack of properly configured DKIM and DMARC records provides weaker protection against email spoofing and phishing.
Low Risk
Lack of DNSSEC: The main domain oak.gs does not have DNSSEC enabled, leaving it theoretically vulnerable to DNS spoofing and cache poisoning.
7.2. Positive Findings
No critical SSL/TLS vulnerabilities (like Heartbleed), SQL Injection, or unauthorized access to sensitive files or cloud metadata services were detected on sign.oak.gs.
7.3. General Security Recommendations
Comprehensive Subdomain Management: Create and maintain a regularly updated inventory of all active subdomains. Decommission any subdomains and their DNS records that are no longer in use.
Enhance DNS Security: Enable DNSSEC for oak.gs and its critical subdomains. In addition to the existing SPF record, configure DKIM and DMARC with strict policies.
Expand Application Security Testing: Conduct regular, comprehensive web application penetration tests on www.oak.gs and all other subdomains.
Implement Effective Monitoring and Patch Management: Establish centralized logging and security monitoring (e.g., SIEM) for all critical systems. Maintain a regular patch management process for all software, libraries, and operating systems.
