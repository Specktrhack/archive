üéØ 1. Detection and Analysis of Security Vulnerabilities
üåü 1.1. Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to pinpoint security vulnerabilities on the internet-facing services of our target systems: 

Metasploitable and a Windows Host. Based on the data provided, we've conducted a detailed analysis of their running services and potential weaknesses.


üó∫Ô∏è 1.2. Information Gathering and Discovery
The core of any cybersecurity assessment lies in detailed information gathering. This process involves IP Address and Network Discovery, Service Detection, Operating System Detection, and Vulnerability Scanning. We used powerful tools like 


Nmap and Nessus to get a comprehensive view of the systems.

üìù 1.3. Vulnerability Analysis and Reporting
In this section, we dissected the security flaws and system configurations using Nessus outputs and system commands. The project's aim is to demonstrate skills in analyzing and reporting on vulnerability scan data.


üõ†Ô∏è 2. Information Gathering and Discovery Steps
A typical cybersecurity assessment process includes:


üìç IP Address and Network Info: Identifying the target's network location (IP address) and basic configuration.


üö™ Service Detection (Port Scanning): Using tools like Nmap to find running services (HTTP, FTP, SSH) and their open ports. The 

nmap -sv -sc -p- command is great for getting service versions, running default scripts, and scanning all ports.


üíª Operating System Detection: Estimating the OS and its version using network fingerprinting with tools like Nmap and Nessus.


üî¨ Vulnerability Scanning: Using automated scanners like Nessus to check for known vulnerabilities against a vast database and report potential risks.

üî¨ 3. Metasploitable Host (10.10.1.2) Analysis
The Metasploitable VM at 

10.10.1.2 is a test system intentionally designed with numerous security holes.

üß∞ 3.1. Tools and Information Sources Used

Nessus Professional:


Server URL: https://10.10.1.6:8834 (Username: sysadm) 


Version: 10.8.4 


Scan Policies: "Advanced Scan" & "Basic Network Scan" 


Linux Command Line Tools:

uname -a, uptime, df -h, sudo dmidecode, cat /etc/passwd

Nmap (Network Mapper):


nmap -sVsS 10.10.1.2 -p- 

üñ•Ô∏è 3.2. System Information

Operating System: Linux metasploitable 2.6.24-16-server (Ubuntu 8.04 based) 


Uptime: 6 hours and 22 minutes


Hardware: QEMU Standard PC with 1 Core @ 2000 MHz and 2048 MB RAM 


User Accounts: Numerous user accounts (root, msfadmin, postgres, etc.) are present. The 

msfadmin password is "msfadmin". Passwords for many key users are set to never expire, which is a significant security risk!

üí• 3.4. Critical Level Vulnerabilities
Plugin ID 51988: Bind Shell Backdoor!

Description: Port 1524 is listening with a root shell that requires NO authentication. This is a critical backdoor providing full system access.



Recommendation: ‚úÖ Shut down this backdoor IMMEDIATELY and investigate the system for compromise.

Plugin ID 77823: Bash "Shellshock"

Description: The system's Bash version is vulnerable to Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271), allowing remote code execution.


Recommendation: ‚úÖ Update the Bash version urgently.

Plugin ID 134862: Apache Tomcat "Ghostcat"

Description: The AJP connector is vulnerable to Ghostcat (CVE-2020-1938), allowing file reading and potential RCE. Nessus confirmed it could read 

web.xml.


Recommendation: ‚úÖ Secure the AJP connector or upgrade the Tomcat server immediately.

üí£ 3.6. Potential Metasploit Exploitation Scenarios
Many vulnerabilities are easily exploitable with Metasploit:

vsftpd 2.3.4 Backdoor

Vulnerability: A malicious username can trigger a backdoor shell on port 6200/TCP.


Metasploit Module: exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor 


Scenario: An attacker can gain a root shell session instantly.

UnrealIRCd Backdoor

Vulnerability: A specific command string triggers remote code execution.


Metasploit Module: exploit/unix/irc/unreal_ircd_3281_backdoor 


Scenario: The attacker can execute commands through the IRC server.

üíª 4. Windows Host (10.10.1.29) Vulnerability Analysis
An uncredentialed scan was performed on the Windows host 

10.10.1.29.


Operating System: Estimated as Microsoft Windows 10 


Hostname: Std19 


Active Service: Port 3389/TCP - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) 

‚ö†Ô∏è 4.3. High-Level Vulnerabilities
Plugin ID 42873: SSL Medium Strength Ciphers (SWEET32)


Description: The RDP service supports weak 3DES ciphers (CVE-2016-2183).


Recommendation: ‚úÖ Disable medium-strength ciphers and enforce strong ones.

üí° 5. General Security Recommendations
For 

both systems:


ü©π Patch Management: URGENTLY update all operating systems and services. The Metasploitable host (Ubuntu 8.04) is end-of-life and must be migrated to a supported OS immediately.



‚öôÔ∏è Secure Configuration: Disable insecure services like Telnet, rlogin, and rsh. Enforce modern TLS 1.2+ with strong ciphers.



üîë Strong Authentication: Use strong, unique passwords and change all defaults. Use key-based authentication for SSH instead of passwords.



üî• Network Security: Use a firewall to block all unnecessary ports. Disable the outdated SMBv1 protocol.



üîÑ Regular Scans: Perform regular authenticated and unauthenticated vulnerability scans to continuously monitor your security posture.
